# ⚡ Webhook Tester

A fast, efficient, and privacy-focused webhook tester.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Testing**: Instantly see incoming webhook requests.
- **Privacy First**: All data is streamed directly to your browser - nothing is stored on our servers.
- **Local Storage**: Request history is saved in your browser's IndexedDB for your reference.
- **Multiple Endpoints**: Create and manage multiple webhook URLs.
- **Request Details**: View detailed information about each incoming request.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Create a new webhook URL on the platform.
2. Use this URL in your application or service that needs to send webhooks.
3. When a request is sent to your webhook URL, it's instantly forwarded to your browser.
4. View and analyze the incoming webhook data in real-time.
5. Your request history is saved locally in your browser for future reference.
